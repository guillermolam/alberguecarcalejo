1 – Microservice Coverage
Expectation	Current Prompt	Gap / Change Needed
Five Rust services each with full DDD layout and WASM build tasks	Only booking‑, validation‑, country‑, security‑, rate‑services listed, but country‑, security‑, rate‑limiter have no sub‑directories, tests, nor individual build scripts in the ASCII tree	Expand tree to show domain/, application/, ports/, adapters/, infrastructure/, and tests/ for every service; ensure matching build:wasm:<name> script for each
Shared crates / workspace for cross‑service models	Not mentioned	Add Cargo.toml workspace with members = ["services/*"] and a shared crate for DTOs

2 – Tooling & Quality Gates
Expectation	Current Prompt	Gap / Change
npm‑run‑all listed in devDependencies (needed by build:wasm)	Missing (update attempt failed)	Append "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5" to devDependencies
stylelint config file path	stylelint.config.cjs shown, but no script calls npm run lint:css	Add "lint:css": "stylelint \"src/**/*.{css,scss}\"" and reference in QA matrix
Storybook build script	Only storybook dev present	Add "storybook:build": "cd frontend && storybook build" for CI snapshot
Performance testing for API with k6	Has script but no test file references	Clarify test location tests/perf/api-load.js and provide sample script

3 – Database & Migration
Expectation	Current Prompt	Gap / Change
sqlx CLI install step	Not documented in run instructions	Add cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features native-tls,postgres before migrations
Neon connection pooling advice (@neondatabase/serverless for gateway)	Not mentioned	Add gateway adapter note: use Neon “serverless driver” for heavier traffic

4 – Frontend Details
Expectation	Current Prompt	Gap / Change
Enzyme deprecation → prefer React Testing Library	Prompt still cites Enzyme	Replace with @testing-library/react in devDeps and scripts
vite-plugin-inspect observability mention but no install	Not in devDeps	Add "vite-plugin-inspect": "^0.8.2" and note to include in vite.config.ts
Tailwind purge / content array	Only mentioned	Provide example content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"]

5 – Gateway & Auth
Expectation	Current Prompt	Gap / Change
Rate‑limit / Helmet config sample	Only listed	Provide minimal code stub in gateway/src/index.ts illustrating use of express-rate-limit, helmet, and Auth0 middleware
JWT re‑check in microservices	Mentioned conceptually	Add tiny Rust middleware example in each service (tower::Service) that verifies Authorization header before hitting application layer

6 – CI/CD & Lint
Expectation	Current Prompt	Gap / Change
GitHub Actions with jobs: lint‑ui, lint‑rs, test‑ui, test‑api, test‑e2e, build‑wasm	Not defined	Provide .github/workflows/ci.yml skeleton
Pre‑commit hooks (husky / lint‑staged)	Absent	Add note to configure husky for prettier + eslint + stylelint

Summary for Replit AI
Expand every Rust service directory with full DDD scaffolding and add missing build:wasm:<name> tasks.

Add npm‑run‑all dependency and fix CSS lint + Storybook build scripts.

Swap Enzyme for React Testing Library, include vite‑plugin‑inspect, and supply concrete Tailwind content array.

Insert sqlx‑cli install into setup instructions and mention Neon serverless driver for gateway.

Provide sample Express and Rust auth/rate‑limit stubs.

Deliver GitHub Actions CI skeleton plus husky hooks.
