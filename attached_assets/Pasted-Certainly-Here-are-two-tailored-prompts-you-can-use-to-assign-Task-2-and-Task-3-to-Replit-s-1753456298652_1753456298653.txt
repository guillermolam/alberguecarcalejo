Certainly! Here are two tailored prompts you can use to assign **Task 2** and **Task 3** to Replit's assistant or agent, mentioning relevant files and expected outcomes:

---

## ðŸ§© Prompt for Taskâ€¯2 â€“ *Validation Service OCR Refactor*

**Task 2: Refactor `validation-service` module**
You will refactor the existing OCR and document validation logic to fit the DDD + hexagonal architecture and relocate test assets.

### Instructions:

1. In `services/validation-service/src/`, move current OCR logic, DNI/NIE/MRZ parsers into:

   ```
   validation-service/src/domain/validators/
   ```
2. Define a Trait `OcrClient` in the `ports/` folder to abstract validation operations.
3. Create an adapter implementation in:

   ```
   validation-service/src/adapters/tesseract.rs
   ```

   that implements `OcrClient` and processes the OCR logic.
4. Move all training data files currently under `attached_assets/` into:

   ```
   services/validation-service/tests/ocr-training/
     â”œâ”€ dni-nif/
     â”œâ”€ passports/
     â””â”€ nie-tie/
   ```

   and update unit tests under `validation-service/tests/` to use these files programmatically.
5. Add new unit tests in `validation-service/tests/` to assert:

   * Known DNI/NIE/Passport samples return expected parsed output.
   * Invalid or missing input returns proper validation errors.

### Testing:

* Run `cargo test -p validation-service`
* All tests must pass.
* Tests must cleanly reference the training assets loaded at runtime by relative paths.

### Definition of Done:

* All OCR and parser logic is in `domain/`.
* `OcrClient` trait and adapter exist.
* Training data is structured and accessible in tests.
* Unit tests run cleanly and validate core parsing logic.

## ðŸ§© Prompt for Taskâ€¯3 â€“ *Booking Service DDD Layout*

**Task 3: Refactor `booking-service` to DDD/hexagonal layout**
Organize the booking service into domain, application, ports, and adapter layers, while integrating shared DTOs and notification traits.

### Instructions:

1. In `services/booking-service/src/`, create/fill:

   ```
   domain/booking.rs            // Define Booking entity, value objects, and validations
   application/create_booking.rs // Use-case logic: validation, repository save, notification trigger
   ports/booking_repository.rs    // Trait to abstract persistence
   ports/notification_sender.rs   // Trait for sending notifications (email/SMS/telegram)
   adapters/db_repository.rs      // Implements repository using `sqlx` and Postgres (neondb)
   adapters/notification_smtp.rs  // Implements notifications via SMTP / Twilio / Telegraf
   ```
2. In `services/booking-service/src/lib.rs`, import and wire:

   * Application service with real domain object
   * Adapters injected into ports (repo, notification)
   * HTTP endpoint handler (or Spin component) calls application service
3. Use shared DTOs defined in `shared/src/lib.rs` for contract between gateway/frontend and booking-service.

### Testing:

* Write unit tests in `booking-service/tests/` covering:

  * Domain validation of `Booking`
  * The `CreateBookingService` flow: saving, notification stub
  * Inputs with invalid data should trigger domain errors
* Run: `cargo test -p booking-service`

### Definition of Done:

* Files and layers created and properly separated.
* All tests pass without lint or clippy errors.
* Shared DTOs used consistently.
* No business logic exists outside `domain` or `application`.

---

ðŸ§  **Important Note**: After finishing each task, run the full test suite (`npm run test:ui`, `cargo test`, lint checks) and report:

* Files created/modified
* Tests passed/failing
* Any missing imports or blockers

If you're unsure or a required file is missing or ambiguous, stop and ask before proceeding.

These prompts should be precise enough for Replitâ€™s assistant (or any developer) to start implementing these tasks modularly and in a test-driven way.
